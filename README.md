# Spam-Classification-with-Embeddings-and-LSTM
This project involved a dataset consisting of SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham (non-spam). The goal was to classify new SMS messages as either spam or ham based on the content of the message.<br>
To achieve this, a model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) was implemented. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that is particularly effective in processing and classifying sequential data, making it suitable for tasks like text classification.<br>
